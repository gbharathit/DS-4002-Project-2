# Charlottesville Weather Forecast Project

This repository contains a dataset of historical weather data for Charlottesville, VA, as well as scripts and outputs to forecast 2024 monthly average temperatures. Our project analyzes trends, seasonality, and anomalies in monthly minimum and maximum temperatures from 2000â€“2023 using ARIMA modeling. The cleaned dataset, exploratory analyses, and model predictions are included to enable reproduction of all results.
